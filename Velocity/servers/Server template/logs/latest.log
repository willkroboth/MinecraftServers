[18:30:00] [main/INFO]: Velocity and some of its plugins collect metrics and send them to bStats (https://bStats.org).
[18:30:00] [main/INFO]: bStats collects some basic information for plugin authors, like how many people use
[18:30:00] [main/INFO]: their plugin and their total player count. It's recommended to keep bStats enabled, but
[18:30:00] [main/INFO]: if you're not comfortable with this, you can opt-out by editing the config.txt file in
[18:30:00] [main/INFO]: the '/plugins/bStats/' folder and setting enabled to false.
[18:30:00] [main/INFO]: Done (0.61s)!
